# vendia-visualization

Vendia-l√∏bet is a danish adventure-race for voluntary scouts. When a team reaches a checkpoint, their progress is reported to a central server (using a QR-code at the checkpoint), and the centralized data is used to monitor the progress of the race as well as the status of the system.

Checkpoints are generally arranged in a sequential order, although checkpoints can be skipped by teams, and hidden or bonus checkpoints might occur on the route. Minor races within the race can occur, where checkpoints are placed closer and can be visited by the teams in random order. Hence the order of the checkpoints is not assumed to be numeric.
